# Our Story 💕

## How We Met: A Vancouver Love Story

Picture this: Two souls in the beautiful city of Vancouver, blissfully unaware that cupid was about to work some serious magic. We first crossed paths through a mutual friend who clearly deserves credit as our unofficial matchmaker (and probably expects the best wedding favors).

## Northern Lights & First Sparks ✨

Before romance even entered the picture, we found ourselves on an epic adventure to the Yukon with friends, chasing the Northern Lights. Little did we know we'd find our own kind of magic right there in the group! The aurora borealis was stunning, but apparently not as captivating as the conversations we started having under those starlit skies.

## The Great Swimming Pool Strategy 🏊‍♀️

Here's where Sneha proved she's a strategic mastermind. Suddenly, dance classes became a thing. Then mysteriously, she acquired a fob to Abhinav's building pool. Coincidence? We think not! She even recruited her friend Ria as backup for "swimming lessons" - because nothing says subtle like bringing reinforcements to your crush's pool. The plan worked brilliantly, and those pool sessions led to some of our best heart-to-heart walks around the neighborhood.

## Stanley Park & The First Official Date 🚴‍♂️

When Abhinav finally worked up the courage to ask Sneha to dinner, we both knew something special was brewing. Our first real date? Cycling through the iconic Stanley Park followed by an amazing dinner and dessert that was so good, it probably deserves its own wedding invitation. Those bike rides with the Lions Gate Bridge and snow-capped mountains as our backdrop became our thing - romantic AND a great workout!

## Adventures & Opposites Attract 🏄‍♂️

From there, we were inseparable. We partied together, had epic game nights at Abhinav's place (where Sneha discovered his competitive side in board games), tried surfing (where we discovered water sports are harder than they look), and went on camping trips that tested our relationship survival skills. Spoiler alert: We passed with flying colors!

The best part? We're complete opposites in the best way. Sneha's sweet tooth meets Abhinav's fitness obsession, creating the perfect balance of "let's try that new tiramisu place" followed by "but first, let's hike to earn it!"

## The Office, RV Adventures & A Proposal 📺🚐💍

Our first TV show as a couple was _The Office_ - which basically means our relationship foundation was built on Jim and Pam references and way too many "World's Best Boss" mug jokes. We're still convinced Dwight would approve of our camping skills.

Recently, we took our biggest adventure yet: a 10-day RV trip with our closest friends through the Canadian Rockies. Between navigating mountain roads, campfire cooking disasters, and taking turns being the designated RV driver, Abhinav was secretly planning something big. At the breathtakingly beautiful Moraine Lake - with its impossibly blue water and mountain backdrop - he got down on one knee and asked Sneha to be his adventure partner for life. (She said yes, obviously, but not before making sure someone got photos!)

## From Montreal to "I Do" 🍁

Our most recent adventure took us to Montreal and Quebec City, where we fell in love with cobblestone streets, French pastries, and yes, more incredible tiramisu (some traditions never change). Every trip we take just confirms what we already know - we're better together, whether we're getting lost in a new city or perfectly synchronized in sharing dessert.

## What We Love About Each Other ❤️

**Abhinav loves that Sneha:** Brings out his adventurous side, introduces him to the finer things in life (like really good desserts), and can make any ordinary day feel like a celebration.

**Sneha loves that Abhinav:** Keeps her active and healthy, plans the most thoughtful surprises, and somehow makes even the most mundane activities (like grocery shopping) fun.

**We both love:** Traveling together, discovering new places, sharing tiramisu, binge-watching shows, outdoor adventures, and the fact that we can spend hours talking and never run out of things to say.

## Looking Forward 🌟

From the Northern Lights to Moraine Lake, from Stanley Park bike rides to RV road trips, every adventure has led us here - to December 10th & 11th, 2025, when we'll officially become the Jains!

We can't wait to celebrate with all of you in beautiful Udaipur, where our next chapter begins. And yes, there will definitely be tiramisu at the reception. Some things are non-negotiable! 😉
